- Features move between status levels (Not Started ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Complete)
- New components or screens are implemented
- Testing milestones are reached
- Architecture decisions impact feature scope

## üìù PHASE 1 LESSONS LEARNED

### Authentication & Routing Issues
**Problem**: Next.js router redirect loops and sign out not clearing sessions properly
**Solution**: Use `window.location.href` for reliable redirects instead of `router.replace()` 
**Key Insight**: Framework routing vs browser navigation - sometimes simpler is better

### Mock vs Real Authentication
**Problem**: Development mode needed to work with test phone numbers due to Supabase SMS limitations
**Solution**: Hybrid authentication system supporting both mock users (localStorage) and real Supabase sessions
**Key Insight**: Plan for development/testing constraints early in authentication design

### State Management Timing
**Problem**: Authentication state loading asynchronously caused redirect race conditions
**Solution**: Added redirect guards (`hasRedirected` state) and proper loading states
**Key Insight**: Always guard against multiple redirects in auth flows

### Phone Number Validation
**Problem**: Singapore mobile numbers initially failed validation with specific formats
**Solution**: Comprehensive validation for 8-digit Singapore mobile numbers (+65 prefix)
**Key Insight**: Test with real local phone number formats, not just theoretical patterns

### Error Handling in Protected Routes
**Problem**: Auth context errors caused blank screens on protected pages
**Solution**: Wrap `useAuth()` calls in try-catch with fallback values
**Key Insight**: Error boundaries are essential for authentication-dependent components
