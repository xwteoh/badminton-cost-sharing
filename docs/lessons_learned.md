## üé® Framework & Platform Issues

### LL-001: Project Misunderstanding During Initial Documentation
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Category**: Requirements  
**Time Lost**: 2 hours

#### Problem
Initially documented the project as a "court booking system" based on limited context, requiring complete rewrite of project documentation when actual requirements were discovered (cost-sharing app for badminton sessions).

#### Root Cause
Made assumptions about project scope without thoroughly reviewing all available project plans and requirements documentation first.

#### Solution
- Read all files in `docs/plans/` directory to understand complete project scope
- Completely rewrote `project_context.md` to reflect actual cost-sharing business model
- Updated all subsequent documentation to align with financial tracking requirements

#### Prevention
1. Always read ALL project documentation before making assumptions
2. Ask clarifying questions if project scope is unclear
3. Start with requirements gathering phase before documentation
4. Cross-reference multiple sources of truth (plans, wireframes, requirements)

## üíª Language & Type System

### LL-002: File Creation vs Editing Tool Confusion
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Severity**: üü¢ Low  
**Category**: Language  
**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

#### Problem
Attempted to use MultiEdit tool on non-existent `SESSION_STATE.md` file, causing tool error since MultiEdit requires existing files.

#### Root Cause
Confusion between Write tool (for new files) and Edit/MultiEdit tools (for existing files) when working programmatically.

#### Solution
- Use Write tool to create new files first
- Then use Edit/MultiEdit for subsequent modifications
- Check file existence before choosing appropriate tool

#### Prevention
1. Always verify file existence before editing
2. Use Write tool for initial file creation
3. Use Edit/MultiEdit only for existing files
4. Document tool usage patterns in development standards

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

### LL-003: Financial Application Security Architecture Complexity
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Time Lost**: 4 hours

#### Problem
Creating comprehensive security standards for a financial application required extensive research and multiple iterations to cover all necessary security aspects (OWASP, NIST, mobile security, etc.).

#### Root Cause
Financial applications have significantly more complex security requirements than typical web apps, requiring specialized knowledge of financial data protection, PCI compliance concepts, and precise monetary calculations.

#### Solution
- Researched OWASP Top 10, NIST standards, and mobile financial app security
- Created comprehensive security standards covering input validation, authentication, data protection
- Established mandatory use of Decimal.js for all financial calculations
- Implemented strict TypeScript configurations for type safety

#### Prevention
1. Start security planning early in financial projects
2. Use established security frameworks (OWASP, NIST) as foundation
3. Research industry-specific compliance requirements
4. Plan for 100% test coverage on financial calculations
5. Use specialized libraries (Decimal.js) for monetary operations

## ‚ö° Performance & Optimization

### LL-004: Mobile-First Design System Complexity
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Category**: Performance  
**Time Lost**: 3 hours

#### Problem
Creating a comprehensive mobile-first design system required extensive consideration of touch targets, responsive breakpoints, Singapore-specific requirements, and financial data display patterns.

#### Root Cause
Mobile-first design for financial applications involves more complexity than typical responsive design - requires consideration of touch accessibility, currency formatting, offline functionality, and local payment methods (PayNow).

#### Solution
- Established minimum 44px touch targets for iOS/Android compliance
- Created comprehensive responsive breakpoint system (320px ‚Üí 1200px)
- Designed Singapore-specific components (phone validation, PayNow integration)
- Developed financial-specific color system and typography scales

#### Prevention
1. Start with mobile constraints first, then scale up
2. Research local market requirements early (PayNow, phone formats)
3. Use established accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
4. Plan for offline-first financial operations
5. Consider cultural and language requirements

## üî• Backend & Integration

### LL-005: Placeholder Content in Documentation Files
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Severity**: üü¢ Low  
**Category**: Backend  
**Time Lost**: 1 hour

#### Problem
User discovered that `folder_structure.md` still contained placeholder content like `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[DATE]` etc., requiring complete rewrite to make it project-specific.

#### Root Cause
Template files were not properly customized during initial documentation setup, leaving generic placeholders instead of badminton project-specific content.

#### Solution
- Completely replaced all placeholder content with badminton-specific information
- Updated folder structure to reflect Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Added domain-specific naming conventions and examples
- Included badminton business logic file organization

#### Prevention
1. Always replace ALL placeholder content during initial setup
2. Create project-specific examples instead of generic ones
3. Review all template files for completeness before proceeding
4. Use find-and-replace to ensure no placeholders remain
5. Double-check file content matches actual project requirements
