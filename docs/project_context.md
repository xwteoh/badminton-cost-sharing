## ðŸ“Š **Quick Reference Summary**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Core Business Model**
- **Cost Sharing**: Variable session costs split equally among all attendees
- **Running Tab System**: Players can play with debt, settle payments when convenient
- **Session Management**: Sessions planned 2 weeks ahead with post-session cost recording
- **Payment Tracking**: PayNow transfers confirmed via WhatsApp with manual recording

### ðŸ’³ **Payment System Essentials**
- **Flexible Debt**: No pre-payment required, players maintain running balance
- **Variable Costs**: Court hourly rate + shuttlecocks used, calculated per session

## 2. App Architecture

### System Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js 15)
â”œâ”€â”€ Authentication (Phone + OTP)
â”œâ”€â”€ Session Recording Interface
â”œâ”€â”€ Payment Tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ Player Balance Dashboard
â””â”€â”€ Organizer Management Panel

Backend (Supabase)
â”œâ”€â”€ PostgreSQL Database with RLS
â”œâ”€â”€ Phone/OTP Authentication
â”œâ”€â”€ Real-time Balance Updates
â””â”€â”€ Database Functions for Calculations
```

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Phone + OTP for all users (organizer/player roles)
2. **Session Workflow**: Plan session â†’ record attendance â†’ calculate costs â†’ update balances
3. **Payment Workflow**: Receive PayNow â†’ record payment â†’ update player balance
4. **Real-time Updates**: Balance changes sync across all connected clients

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with phone/OTP verification
- **Data Protection**: Row Level Security (RLS) for role-based access control
- **Privacy**: Players only see their own data, organizers see all data

## 6. Business Rules & Implementation

### Core Business Rules

#### Rule 1: Session Cost Calculation
- **Description**: Session costs = (hours Ã— court rate) + (shuttlecocks Ã— shuttle rate), split equally among all attendees
- **Implementation**: PostgreSQL functions calculate costs and update player balances
- **Validation**: Minimum 1 player attendance, positive hours/shuttlecock values
- **Error Handling**: Recalculation on session edits, historical rate preservation

#### Rule 2: Running Tab System
- **Description**: Players can have negative balances (debt) without payment restrictions
- **Implementation**: Balance tracking through session costs minus payments
- **Validation**: No debt limits, overpayments become credit
- **Error Handling**: Payment corrections via adjustment records

#### Rule 3: Role-Based Access Control
- **Description**: Organizers manage all data, players only see their own information
- **Implementation**: Supabase RLS policies + RoleGuard component protection
- **Validation**: Phone number authentication, default 'player' role assignment
- **Error Handling**: Clear permission denied messages with automatic redirects
- **Access Control**: RoleGuard component prevents unauthorized page access

#### Rule 4: Temporary Player Handling
- **Description**: Drop-in players share equal costs but don't become permanent members
- **Implementation**: Session_players table with temporary player flags
- **Validation**: Can convert temporary to regular players
- **Error Handling**: Prevent duplicate regular/temporary player entries

### System Constraints
1. **Session Planning**: 2-week advance limit for session creation
2. **Payment Methods**: PayNow primary, cash/bank transfer supported
3. **Data Retention**: Preserve debt history for deactivated players

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Privacy**: Minimal data collection (name + phone only)
- **Financial Records**: Audit trail for all payments and adjustments

---

## 7. User Experience Philosophy

### Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Organizer records sessions on phone during/after games
2. **Speed**: Session recording in <2 minutes, payment entry in <1 minute
3. **Visual Clarity**: Immediate debt/credit status with color coding
4. **Error Prevention**: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Accessibility
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Features**: Large touch targets (44px minimum), clear visual hierarchy
- **Testing**: Manual testing on various devices and screen sizes

### Performance Goals
- **Session Recording**: <2 minutes from start to completion
- **Payment Processing**: <1 minute to record received payment
- **Balance Calculation**: Real-time updates without page refresh
- **Offline Support**: View balance and history when connectivity is poor

---

## 8. Operational Limits & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Database**: Supabase free tier limits (500MB, 2GB bandwidth/month)
- **Authentication**: Phone OTP rate limits (5 requests/minute per IP)
- **Real-time**: 200 concurrent connections on free tier

### Business Constraints
- **Single Group**: MVP supports one badminton group per deployment
- **Manual Payments**: PayNow transfers confirmed via WhatsApp group
- **Organizer Dependency**: All cost and payment recording requires organizer

### Scalability Considerations
- **Current Capacity**: 50 active players per group, 100 sessions per month
- **Growth Plan**: Multi-group support requires database schema updates
- **Bottlenecks**: Manual payment confirmation, single organizer workflow
